abstract = {The continuous growth of on-chip transistors driven by technology scaling urges architecture developers to design and implement novel architectures to effectively utilize the excessive on-chip resources. Due to the challenges of programming in register-transfer level (RTL) languages, performance modeling based on simulation is typically developed alongside hardware implementation, allowing the exploration of high-level design decisions before dealing with the error-prone, low-level RTL details. However, this approach also introduces new challenges in coordinating across multiple teams to align implementation details separate codebases.In this paper, we address this issue by presenting Assassyn, a unified, high-level, and general-purpose programming framework for architectural simulation and implementation. By taking advantage of the concept of asynchronous event handling, a widely existing behavior in both hardware design and implementation and software engineering, a general-purpose, and high-level programming abstraction is proposed to mitigate the difficulties of RTL programming. Moreover, the unified programming interface naturally enables an accurate and faithful alignment between the simulation-based performance modeling and RTL implementation.Our evaluation demonstrates that Assassyn’s high-level programming interface is sufficiently expressive to implement a wide range of architectures, from architectural components, and application-specific accelerators, to designs as complicated as out-of-order CPUs. All the generated simulators perfectly align with the generated RTL behavior, while achieving 2.2-8.1 \texttimes{} simulation speedup, and requiring 70\% lines of code. The generated RTL achieves comparable perf/area compared to handcrafted RTL, and 6 \texttimes{} perf/area compared to high-level synthesis generated RTL code by introducing by mean 1.26 \texttimes{} lines of code overhead.},
