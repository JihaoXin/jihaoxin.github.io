Sapio et al. [7] show that communication can take up to 90% of a training iteration. A popular remedy is to reduce the size of communication data between nodes by applying gradient compression methods [1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11]. Unfortunately, a majority of the proposed compressors are not natively compatible with the AllReduce collective communication primitive because of the change in data format and the need for custom reduction operations. To the best of our knowledge, the only compressors compatible with AllReduce are PowerSGD [10] and IntSGD [5, 7]. However, practical implementations of these methods are heuristic-based and do not come with rigorous theoretical guarantees. Concurrently, C-Coll [4] proposes error-bounded lossy compression with MPI collectives. We address this question can we provide theoretical guarantees for gradient compression while retaining AllReduce compatibility for an efficient implementation?","tags":null,"title":"Global QSGD: Practical Floatless Quantization for Distributed Learning with Theoretical Guarantees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingxuan Mao","Xinying Feng","Jihao Xin","Tommy W.

First, the CNN voltage prediction model is constructed by comparing the performance of the different neural network algorithms with the different convolution kernel sizes. The image information of the pavement PV array is then used as the input, and we use the CNN model to forecast its MPP voltage in a short amount of time. Finally, a series of simulation and experimental tests are done, and the prediction results of the MPP voltage under different shading conditions show that the proposed prediction model can effectively predict the MPP voltage of pavement PV array in a robust way.","tags":null,"title":"A Convolutional Neural Network Based Maximum Power Point Voltage Forecasting Method for Pavement PV Array","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nian Xue","Daojing Guo","Jie Zhang","Jihao Xin","Zhen Li","Xin Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628380800,"objectID":"01399bf90c5346999a914a0155669039","permalink":"https://jihaoxin.github.io/publication/iot/","publishdate":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iot/","section":"publication","summary":"The recent surge in the prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been attracting an increasing number of researchers and experts with great attention due to its significant economic and social values. The IoT brings appealing opportunities and new challenges for both the current and future Internet. In practice, various IoT smart devices are generally pre-programmed and deployed specifically in the proper place to fulfill corresponding functions according to divergent requirements. However, lately, these pre-stored functions tend to be upgraded or reprogrammed more frequently on account of the increment of dynamic needs or urgent situations. Inspired by Software Defined Networking (SDN), the authors propose a framework in this work: Software Defined Function (SDF) for IoT, enabling IoT smart devices to be upgraded or reprogrammed securely and remotely. The authors further present a protocol named as OpenFunction stemmed from OpenFlow. Moreover, the security properties of this protocol are analyzed. Finally, the authors implement a preliminary SDF system and evaluate its performance. Experimental results indicate that OpenFunction allows a controller to update or rewrite functions in IoT devices, as well as to obtain flexibility and security. Accordingly, this work contributes to the future fusion of SDN and IoT technologies.","tags":null,"title":"OpenFunction for Software Defined IoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
